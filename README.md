This is some of the oldest code I wrote, and it's just been sitting in my github this whole time. The .8xp files can be copied directly to a calculator. The text files of the same name are what I got when I converted them to text using cemetech's sourcecoder[cemetech.net/sc].

So, some explanation. I hated dealing with polynomials back in High School, and this was the first large-scale project I did. It breaks down a polynomials (of any number of variables) into a nice form, preforms the requested operations on it (I think it only supports multiply, add, and subtract), and then prints it back in a nice way.

You may notice some odd things, like unterminated strings and such. That's just TI-Basic being TI-Basic... Strings and function calls don't need to be terminated. I'll eventually try to go through and add comments where I can... Though the code is honestly as much a mystery to me as it would be to anyone else (I had documentation somewhere, but... high school.)
